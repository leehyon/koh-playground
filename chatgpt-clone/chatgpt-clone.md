# Building a ChatGPT Clone

The application is developed with Flask and has a simple frontend interface. Users can input text and receive responses generated by the OpenAI language model.

The chatbot can engage in *contextual* conversations.

## Technical requirements

The following items are required:

- Python 3.7 or later installed
- The Flask framework installed in your Python virtual environment
- An OpenAI API key

> It is crucial to establish a Python virtual environment to maintain separate dependencies from other projects on your machine. Personally, I prefer using miniconda.

## How to build

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Get an API key from OpenAI and place it in `config.py` or set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Start the Flask server by running: `flask run --port 50001`
5. Access the application by opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:50001

## File structure

The main components of the application are as follows:

### app.py

This file contains the Flask application code. It defines the routes and handles the requests from the frontend.

- The `render_template` function is a Flask method that renders an HTML template.
- The `request.args.get()` method is used to retrieve the value of the `msg` parameter from the URL query string.

### config.py

This file stores your API key.

> You can add the `config.py` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your key to git.

#### Alternative: Use the environment variable

> An environment variable is a variable that is set on your operating system, rather than within your application. It consists of a name and value. We recommend that you set the name of the variable to `OPENAI_API_KEY`. By keeping this variable name consistent across your team, you can commit and share your code without the risk of exposing your API key.

OpenAI provides a detailed page on [API key safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).

### index.html

This file contains the HTML template for the frontend interface. It includes an input field for the user to enter text and a button to generate the response.

It utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for creating the user interface and jQuery for managing communication between the frontend and backend.
