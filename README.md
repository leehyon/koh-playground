# Playground

Welcome to my playground repository! This is where I create and test various applications while learning new things.

Feel free to explore the code and test these applications. Please note that since this repository is primarily for learning purposes, the code may not be production-ready or fully optimized.

## Getting started

To get started with any of the applications in this repository, follow the instructions provided in their respective directories. Each application will have its own set of dependencies and setup requirements.

## Contributing

As this repository is primarily for personal learning, I do not currently accept contributions. However, if you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.
